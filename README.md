# 📊 Job Market Analysis for Data Roles (SQL + Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes real-world job postings data to uncover **hiring trends, skill demand, salary patterns, and company hiring behavior** in the data job market.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **end-to-end data analytics skills**:
- Writing analytical SQL queries on a relational database  
- Creating reusable **SQL views** for analysis  
- Building **interactive Power BI dashboards** for business insights

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered
This project answers **14 recruiter-focused business questions**, including:

1. Where are data jobs geographically concentrated?
2. Which skills are most in demand for data roles?
3. How does skill demand vary across different data job titles?
4. Which skills are associated with higher average salaries?
5. What is the relationship between skill demand and salary?
6. How does job demand vary by job type?
7. How has demand for data jobs changed over time?
8. Which companies are hiring the most for data roles?
9. What are the most common **skill combinations** required in data jobs?
10. How do skill requirements differ across job roles? 
11. Which data roles show growth trends over time?
12. What insights can job seekers use to prioritize skill learning?

## 🗄️ Dataset & Database Schema
The analysis uses a **relational database structure**, similar to real-world company systems:

- `job_postings_fact`
- `skills_job_dim`
- `skills_dim`
- `company_dim`

This approach avoids flat-file analysis and reflects how data is handled in production environments.

## 🧠 SQL Analysis
- Extensive use of **JOINs, CTEs, aggregations, and filtering**
- Created **SQL views** for each analytical question
- Queries focus on **business logic**
- Views were directly consumed by Power BI

Example analyses include:
- Skill demand analysis
- Salary vs skill analysis
- Job trends over time
- Skill combination analysis

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboards
SQL views were imported into **Power BI** to create interactive dashboards featuring:

- 🌍 Geographic maps for job locations
- 📊 Bar & column charts for skill demand and company hiring
- 📈 Line charts for job posting trends over time
- 🧩 Matrix visuals for skill combinations
- 🎛️ Slicers for job role and job type filtering

Each dashboard is designed to tell **one clear business story**.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **SQL and Python dominate demand** across nearly all data roles.
- Niche or specialized skills appear in higher-paying roles but have lower demand.
- Hiring is concentrated among a small number of companies.
- Data job demand changes over time, indicating market-driven hiring cycles.
- Employers value **skill combinations**, not just individual tools.
